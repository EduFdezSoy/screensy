CHANGELOG
=========

All notable changes to the screensy project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog [0], and this project adheres to
Semantic Versioning [1].


UNRELEASED
----------


1.2.0 - 2021-08-02
------------------

Added:
- Add localisation based on the browser settings (through the Accept-Language
  header).
- Add the Dutch translation.

Changed:
- In the client, the stream is no longer locked to full-screen on mobile
  devices.
- In the client, more detailed error messages are shown when something goes
  wrong.

Fixed:
- Fixed compilation failure for TypeScript version greater than 4.3.2.

Security:
- Update the dependency 'ws' of the rendezvous server. The old version had a
  vulnerability that can be misused to significantly slow down a webSocket
  server [2].


1.1.0 - 2021-06-07
------------------

Added:
- Include a STUN+TURN server in the Docker setup.

Changed:
- The client now assumes that a STUN or TURN server is hosted on the same domain
  as screensy. Previously, the client used an external STUN server, which is an
  unreliable solution. Also, the client did not use a TURN server.


1.0.3 - 2021-06-06
------------------

Fixed:
- Add words to the list that the client uses to generate room names. This
  decreases the chance that two broadcasters happen to generate the same room
  name.


1.0.2 - 2021-06-03
------------------

Fixed:
- Fix the failing build of the screensy-website Docker image. This happened
  because we did not specify a version of the TypeScript compiler.


1.0.1 - 2021-03-18
------------------

Changed:
- Previously, the website client always used WebSocket Secure for a connection
  to the rendezvous server. Now, the client uses WebSocket if the website is
  served via HTTP, and WebSocket Secure if the website is served via HTTPS.

Added:
- Screensy can now be hosted on a path that is not the root path.


1.0.0 - 2021-03-16
------------------

Added:
- Add the website.
- Add the rendezvous (signaling) server.
- Add Dockerfiles and a docker-compose file for easy deployment with Docker.
- Add a README with instructions on setting up screensy.
- Add this CHANGELOG.
